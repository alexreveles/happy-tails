Suggestions: 
Tattle-Tail (target audience: Dog Shelters: Volunteers) erika maybe to talk more about whether we can hit all requirements with this idea but when i volunteered, they used a whiteboard to track all this. Could be like a blog type of CRUD app but with dog updates
DB to track dogs in shelter kennels (each kennel has an ID), behavior log, when they’ve been walked/pottied for the day (tracked three times a day), breed, age, and if they are available for adoption/in quarantine. Etc.
Incorporate conditional styling for VIEW ALL option 
Green for easy dogs, red for difficult etc.
