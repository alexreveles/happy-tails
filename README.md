Suggestions: 
Tattle-Tail (target audience: Dog Shelters: Volunteers) erika maybe to talk more about whether we can hit all requirements with this idea but when i volunteered, they used a whiteboard to track all this. Could be like a blog type of CRUD app but with dog updates
DB to track dogs in shelter kennels (each kennel has an ID), behavior log, when they’ve been walked/pottied for the day (tracked three times a day), breed, age, and if they are available for adoption/in quarantine. Etc.
Incorporate conditional styling for VIEW ALL option 
Green for easy dogs, red for difficult etc.

USER STORY:
AS a shelter employee/volunteer, I WANT to track the dogs daily activities and dogs difficulty levels so that all the dogs are taken care and paired with a compatible caretaker that meets the required experience (to handle to dogs).

  In order to run this application, When being in the home page you are presented with a sign up form, if you have a login username and password then you will select "Login Instead". Once the User is now logged in you are prompted with the dashboard allowing you to view and identify all dogs in the shelter that havent had a potty break or walk. As a volunteer/User this will quickly help distinguish which dogs have been paired with the Volunteer to be taken cared of and which Canine needs a Volunteer to be taken outside for their daily potty break and walk.
